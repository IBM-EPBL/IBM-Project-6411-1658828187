                1.Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and heart defects you’re born with (congenital
                heart defects), among others.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.The term “heart disease” is often used interchangeably with the term “cardiovascular disease”. Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina)
                or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart’s muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data
                in the healthcare industry is huge. Data mining turns the large collection of raw healthcare data into information that can help to make informed decisions and predictions.

            <p>
                Coronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common type of heart. It develops when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged with plaque. This causes them to harden and narrow. Plaque contains cholesterol
                and other substances. As a result, the blood supply reduces, and the heart receives less oxygen and fewer nutrients. In time, the heart muscle weakens, and there is a risk of heart failure and arrhythmias. When plaque builds up in the
                arteries, it is called atherosclerosis. Plaque in the arteries can rupture from blockages and cause blood flow to stop, which can lead to a heart attack.

            <h4>Physical exam and blood tests:</h4>
            <p>During your appointment, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and your family medical history. They’ll also check your heart rate and blood pressure. Your doctor may also order blood tests. For example, cholesterol tests measure the
                levels of fat and cholesterol in your bloodstream. Your doctor can use these tests to help determine your risk of heart disease and heart attack.</p>

                In the future, these techniques can be applied to a real-time database of the individual patient and by using the same attributes or by adding some more attributes we can determine the prediction of multiple diseases like kidney-related and lungs related
                diseases. We can also implement the algorithms used previously for better results. This can be deployed to android and web platforms to analyze and predict using real-time data & by collaborating with doctors or medical organizations or
                as a common platform for predicting diseases. As an extension to this work and some sort of limitation to the work performed here, different types of classifiers can be included in the analysis, and more in-depth sensitivity analysis can
                be performed on these classifiers, also an extension can be made by applying the same analysis to other diseases datasets, and see the performance of these classifiers to classify and predict these diseases.

            HEARTDISEASE PREDICTION-BEST ML APPROACHES
        </h1>
        <div class="tech">
            <h4>1.Random Forest Classifier</h4>
            <p>
                The random forest algorithm provides flexibility and robustness for classification tasks using tabular data, which few other standard models can. Given its simplicity and versatility, the random forest classifier is widely used for fraud detection, loan
                risk prediction, and predicting heart diseases.

        <div class="tech">
            <h4>2. K-Nearest Neighbors</h4>
            <p>
                As the name says, a k neighbors classifier takes a data point and finds k other data points nearest to it in the vector space. In a supervised fashion, KNN creates clusters of the data samples having the same target value. Whenever a new value needs to
                be classified, it uses a distance metric to assign it to one of the classes. For heart disease detection, there are only two classes that KNN needs to build. Thus, it is pretty robust and efficient for this task. Euclidean distance is
                one of the popular distance metrics used by KNN, but there are many more available.

        <div class="tech">
            <h4>3. Decision Tree classifier</h4>
            <p>
                Decision Trees are the individual models that make a random forest after ensembling. Each decision tree classifier uses the dataset's attributes to create a tree. As shown in the image below, the branches end up in the leaves that are made up of target
                values. Using visual components and an information gain index, the tree identifies the leading features of the labels of each class. Thus, the branches are created that maximize the information gained in each split and lead up to the leaf
                node of that class. Decision trees are fast and robust for disease prediction if the dataset has powerful features for a simple use-case.

            <p>
                A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is a non-probabilistic classifier aiming to generate hyperplanes that divide the data points of two classes in the vector space. For N number of features and M targets, SVM creates M-1 N-dimensional hyperplanes
                that separate data points of different classes from each other. The image below shows how "support" vectors are calculated such that the margin (or distance) between the vectors of two classes is the most. SVM optimizes this margin metric
                to find the best hyperplane for all the categories.

                An ANN is perhaps the most popular machine learning model in today's AI landscape, given its wide applications in deep learning in the form of convolutional neural networks. However, a normal ANN comprised of a handful of linear nodes can perform comparable
                to the best standard ML models. The architecture of a standard ANN is shown in the figure below. As we can see, the hidden layer is the most crucial part of an ANN, and is made up of several linear nodes.

            <P>
                Heart disease prediction is a necessity as well as exigent work in the medical field. The mortality rate can be reduced if the disease is recognized at the initial stages, and precautions and proper treatment are possible. The algorithms are tested using
                various features. Accurate forecasting of the diseases is the goal of the proposed method. The decision classifier approach proved to be very efficacious to predict the diseased using features like age, BMI, cholesterol, and more. Adding
                feature BMI improved the accuracy of prediction. Thus, by assessing the results, the suggested approach generates a more precise prediction of cardiovascular diseases. Our project focuses on analyzing and designing a system where patients’
                real-time information can be processed and evaluated based on previous symptoms and current symptoms for different diseases [2]. We have concluded that KNN, Support Vector, Decision tree, and Random Forest are the best algorithms with
                higher accuracy rates than others for predicting and analysis among these KNN is easy to implement and requires less computational resources and thus could be implemented in a web-based system effortlessly.

            <h4>1.Chest Pain by Age:</h4>
            <p>
                Chest pain is often associated with heart disease, many people with heart disease say they have a vague discomfort that isn't necessarily identified as pain. In general, chest discomfort related to a heart attack or another heart problem may be described
                by or associated with one or more of the following: Pressure, fullness, burning or tightness in your chest Crushing or searing pain that spreads to your back, neck, jaw, shoulders, and one or both arms Pain that lasts more than a few minutes,
                gets worse with activity, goes away and comes back, or varies in intensity Shortness of breath Cold sweats Dizziness or weakness Nausea or vomiting...

            <h4>2.Exploration Of BPvsChestPainType And Gender:</h4>
            <p>
                Sex differences in pain perception are well-described, where female sex has higher somatic awareness compared to male sex (22). This potentially leads to women having greater sensitivity but lower specificity for cardiac chest pain. Further, differing
                phenotypes of biological sex impact pain perception, e.g., younger premenopausal women with relatively high estrogen levels have a greater pain perception compared to older postmenopausal women with lower estrogen levels (23). Younger
                pre-menopausal women are erroneously thought to be “protected” from CAD, and younger women's pain symptoms are more easily discounted. Specifically, socio-cultural gender is documented to contribute to subjective symptoms, where gender
                bias in pain diagnosis and treatment has been identified within the patient-provider encounter and treatment decisions (24). A comprehensive evaluation of sex and gender differences in pain includes proximate cause contributions of experiential
                (abuse, labor, and delivery), psychological (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress), genetic (X chromosome imprinting/Y chromosome), neurochemical (adenosine, cytokine expression), organizational (steroid action in development), activational
                (steroid action in adulthood), systems level (cortical connectivity, vagal nerve modulation), and sociocultural (gender roles, gender role expectations)(25)...

            <h4>3.Exploration Of Max Heart Rate During The Chest Pain:</h4>
            <p>
                Your maximum heart rate is a calculation that helps you figure out what your ideal target heart rate is during exercise. You can estimate your maximum age-related heart rate by subtracting your age from 220Trusted Source. For example, for a 35-year-old person, the estimated maximum age-related heart rate would be calculated as 220 – 35 years = 185 bpm. This maximum heart rate calculation helps you see if you’re exercising too hard or not putting in enough energy. Your target heart rate uses this calculation to reflect the ideal bpm you need for a great workout. When your heart rate is too fast, it’s called tachycardia. For adults, a fast heart rate is defined as above 100 bpmTrusted Source.Tachycardia, which is when your heart rate is faster than it should be, can be caused by underlying health conditions like: anemia, congenital heart disease, heart disease that’s affecting blood flow, hyperthyroidism, injury to the heart, like from a heart attack, ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias, Taking illegal drugs (like stimulants like cocaine or methamphetamines) or misusing prescription medications or non-prescription products (like diet supplements) may also cause your heart to beat too fast. Other, less serious reasons for a fast heart rate include: drinking caffeine, drinking alcohol, stress, physical exercise, pregnancy...

                Blood pressure is the force of blood flowing through a person’s blood vessels. Doctors calculate a person’s blood pressure using two measurements known as systolic and diastolic. Systolic blood pressure is the highest level of force at which the heart pumps blood around the body. Diastolic blood pressure is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. Blood pressure is written with systolic blood pressure first and then diastolic blood pressure, for example, 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). If either measurement is too high, it could mean a person has high blood pressure. If they are too low, it could suggest low blood pressure. The cut-off point for diagnosing high blood pressure does not change with age. If a person needs to know whether their child’s blood pressure is within the normal range, they should ask a doctor for guidance. Normal =Less than 120and Less than 80, Elevated =120–129 and Less than 80, Hypertension =stage 1 130–139 or 80–89, Hypertension =stage 2 140 or higher or 90 or higher, Hypertension crisis =Higher than 180 or Higher than 120...

                Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance, and there are two types: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). If there is too much LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol in the bloodstream, it can build up in blood vessels, forming fatty deposits called plaques.These plaques can lead toTrusted Source other problems, including heart attacks and strokes. Total and LDL cholesterol levels should be low. But having more HDL, or “good,” cholesterol in the blood may reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke. However, kids with risk factors for high cholesterol should have their levels checked more frequently. Typically, males tend to have higher levels throughout their lives than females. A male’s cholesterol levels increase with age, and a female’s cholesterol levels rise after menopause...
